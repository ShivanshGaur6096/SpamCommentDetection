# SpamCommentDetection
I have created a comma-separated values (CSV) dataset using some of the famous youtube channels.
after marking the comments spam or hamm(not spam) given them the value of 1 and 0 respectively.

On 17/06/2019 the model can only predict the comments by putting your text in text-area and predicting it as spam or hamm.

Trying to update this model to (a) classify any messages or text into different categories(more than two). (b) Uploading file to database and then classifying the content of that file into different categories.
